# Consciousness

## Overview

This repository is for records of my personal experiences and investigations into altered states of consciousness. The main question of interest to me is whether or not OBEs (Out of Body Experiences) are internal experiences (i.e. hallucinations within a person's mind) or if they are external experiences. 

I intend to investigate this question as scientifically I can, although I am not a professional researcher and make no claims to be one. I will attempt to refute the hypothesis that OBEs are completely internal and the experiencer cannot access information outside of what he or she can create with his or her own mind.

I will keep a [daily diary](https://github.com/rakudayo/consciousness/tree/master/logs/diary) on the above investigation to record its progress.

In addition, I will be keeping [dream logs](https://github.com/rakudayo/consciousness/tree/master/logs/dreamlog) and other information as recommended by practitioners of OBEs and Lucid Dreams. 

I will also be uploading other information I find to be [pertinent research and links/resources](https://github.com/rakudayo/consciousness/tree/master/research) related to the topic of altered states of consciousness for anyone interested.

## Milestones

Since inducing OBEs appears to take significant practice and the technique is non-trivial, I have created the following milestones for tracking the progress of my experiment. (NOTE: The method I plan to use is the method described [here](http://www.lucidology.com/) in the free Lucidology 101 training course. If this is unsuccessful, I may look into other methods.)

1. **(Completed)** Start training (2012 Aug 09)

2. **(Completed)** Partial waking sleep paralysis (2012 Aug 10)

3. **(Completed)** Full waking sleep paralysis in a single limb (2012 Aug 13)

4. Full waking sleep paralysis in entire body

5. Experience an OBE (separation of "mind" from "body")

6. From an OBE, read a playing card placed in another room by my wife

7. Repeat (6) 100 more times with higher than random success rate

## Results

My experiment is currently still in progress, but there can be only one of two possible outcomes:

1. **Hypothesis disproved** -> Conclusion: OBEs allow the experiencer access to information outside of his or her own mind (i.e. it is an objective experience, not only within the person's head)

2. **Inability to refute hypothesis** -> Conclusion: Inconclusive. OBEs might or might not allow the experiencer access to information outside of his or her mind, but this experiment could not disprove OBEs as an internal-only experience.
