# Brain Wave Patterns

## [Gamma waves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_wave)
- Gamma waves are neural oscillation with a frequency between 25 to 100 Hz, though 40 Hz is prototypical.

## [Beta waves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_wave)
- Beta wave, or beta rhythm, is the term used to designate the frequency range of human brain activity between 12 and 30 Hz.
- Beta states are the states associated with normal waking consciousness.

## [Alpha waves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_wave)
- Alpha waves are neural oscillations in the frequency range of 8–12 Hz.

## [Theta waves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_wave)
- Theta waves are neural oscillations in the frequency range of 4-7 Hz.
- Associated with REM sleep.

## [Delta wave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_wave)
- A delta wave is a high amplitude brain wave with a frequency of oscillation between 0–4 hertz.
- Associated with SW (Slow Wave) sleep.
