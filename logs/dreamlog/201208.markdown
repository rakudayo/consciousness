Do not remember any dreams

My wife came home late and I slept a second time with her. I think I dreamed I was having an OBE (Out of Body Experience). This was probably because I was trying to induce one before sleeping. In the dream, I start to feel myself sink down into my bed. Then I floated up about halfway to the ceiling in my room.

At this point, I started to feel excited and could sense my body below fighting against sleep paralysis in an effort to wake up. Then my mind was instantly back in my body and I "woke up" in my dream. I immediately told a dream version of my wife about the experience so that I could know if it was real or not. Since my real wife doesn't remember me telling her anything, it appears to have only been a dream.

I don't remember much of the dream, but it was night and I was going somewhere outdoors in the countryside of Japan. Suddenly, I was running back to home along the edge of a farm field. As I was running alongside the field, there was something I was supposed to be aware of. I remember feeling that, in the dream, I wasn't the only one who was supposed to be doing what I was doing.
However, as far as I remember I was the only one in the dream.

My family and I (parents and brother) were on vacation somewhere like [the Everglades](https://github.com/rakudayo/consciousness/blob/master/logs/resources/miami-everglades.jpg). We were taking a trip with an old, white-bearded captain (not at all like a pirate). I don't remember what we were going to do. The captain let me use his little [trolling boat](https://github.com/rakudayo/consciousness/blob/master/logs/resources/fish-08-PB061876.jpg) while he was preparing the main boat. 

I got into the little boat and the captain's [little scottish terrier](https://github.com/rakudayo/consciousness/blob/master/logs/resources/Scottish-Terrier-Dog-Breed.jpg) also got in the boat with me. I started going around the cove in the boat, although I didn't know how to steer or slow down. Near the end, I started to speed out of control. I knew I was heading toward disaster but I didn't know how to stop. Luckily, I was able to get my hand on the steering bar near my side and figure out how to slow down.

When I got back to the bigger boat, the captain was angry at me. I felt like he was mostly angry that I endangered his dog's life. I told him I was sorry, but I didn't know how to slow down the boat. He made some response indicating he didn't believe me. This upset and frustrated me, but I simply dismissed it with a "Whatever."

Then, when we got off the boat for some training, I was approached by about 5 people. Three were adults and two were children. All but one of them, probably the older brother of the speaker, had faces that were eerily similar. The speaker asked me if I was from my company and I said yes. He shook my hand and said he is a candidate for my company. I don't remember him saying his name. Another person, his wife I think, who had almost the same face, albeit a bit feminized, shook my hand too. She said "Thank you for everything" or "Thanks for your support". Then I woke up.

Early this morning I was in the kind of half-awake, half-asleep dream world and remember what I was dreaming at that time.
I was dreaming last night that I was [Giz Edwards](http://www.youtube.com/user/GizEdwards) and I was living in England during high school.
There was these three or four bullies who were always bothering me.
But I was really good at fighting and could easily incapacitate them all without hurting them too bad.
It was kind of like Batman's fighting.
However, one of them, the "smart" leader guy, figured out that all they needed to do to weaken me was to break my glasses.
So there were trying to do that and I woke up.
I remember that they didn't seem to hate me, they just wanted me to be as miserable as they were.
I almost felt like an older brother teaching them when I was beating them up.

The only thing I remember from my dreams last night is the image of a mathematician or scientist writing on a blackboard trying to figure out an equation or something. He looks like [this character](https://github.com/rakudayo/consciousness/blob/master/logs/resources/hidetaka-yoshioka.jpg) from a Japanese movie called [ALWAYS: Sunset on Third Street](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488870/).

At the very end of the dream, he wrote something, but it was misspelled in the way a Japanese person might misspell an English word. I believe the word was should have been an r, but was an l instead.
