Do not remember any dreams

My wife came home late and I slept a second time with her. I think I dreamed I was having an OBE (Out of Body Experience). This was probably because I was trying to induce one before sleeping. In the dream, I start to feel myself sink down into my bed. Then I floated up about halfway to the ceiling in my room.

At this point, I started to feel excited and could sense my body below fighting against sleep paralysis in an effort to wake up. Then my mind was instantly back in my body and I "woke up" in my dream. I immediately told a dream version of my wife about the experience so that I could know if it was real or not. Since my real wife doesn't remember me telling her anything, it appears to have only been a dream.

I don't remember much of the dream, but it was night and I was going somewhere outdoors in the countryside of Japan. Suddenly, I was running back to home along the edge of a farm field. As I was running alongside the field, there was something I was supposed to be aware of. I remember feeling that, in the dream, I wasn't the only one who was supposed to be doing what I was doing.
However, as far as I remember I was the only one in the dream.

My family and I (parents and brother) were on vacation somewhere like [the Everglades](https://github.com/rakudayo/consciousness/blob/master/logs/resources/miami-everglades.jpg). We were taking a trip with an old, white-bearded captain (not at all like a pirate). I don't remember what we were going to do. The captain let me use his little [trolling boat](https://github.com/rakudayo/consciousness/blob/master/logs/resources/fish-08-PB061876.jpg) while he was preparing the main boat. 

I got into the little boat and the captain's [little scottish terrier](https://github.com/rakudayo/consciousness/blob/master/logs/resources/Scottish-Terrier-Dog-Breed.jpg) also got in the boat with me. I started going around the cove in the boat, although I didn't know how to steer or slow down. Near the end, I started to speed out of control. I knew I was heading toward disaster but I didn't know how to stop. Luckily, I was able to get my hand on the steering bar near my side and figure out how to slow down.

When I got back to the bigger boat, the captain was angry at me. I felt like he was mostly angry that I endangered his dog's life. I told him I was sorry, but I didn't know how to slow down the boat. He made some response indicating he didn't believe me. This upset and frustrated me, but I simply dismissed it with a "Whatever."

Then, when we got off the boat for some training, I was approached by about 5 people. Three were adults and two were children. All but one of them, probably the older brother of the speaker, had faces that were eerily similar. The speaker asked me if I was from my company and I said yes. He shook my hand and said he is a candidate for my company. I don't remember him saying his name. Another person, his wife I think, who had almost the same face, albeit a bit feminized, shook my hand too. She said "Thank you for everything" or "Thanks for your support". Then I woke up.
