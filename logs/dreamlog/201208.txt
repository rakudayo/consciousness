Do not remember any dreams

2012/08/11 08:30
My wife came home late and I slept a second time with her.
I think I dreamed I was having an OBE (Out of Body Experience).
This was probably because I was trying to induce one before sleeping.
In the dream, I start to feel myself sink down into my bed.
Then I floated up about halfway to the ceiling in my room.
At this point, I started to feel excited and could sense my body below fighting against sleep paralysis in an effort to wake up.
Then my mind was instantly back in my body and I "woke up" in my dream.
I immediately told a dream version of my wife about the experience so that I could know if it was real or not.
Since my real wife doesn't remember me telling her anything, it appears to have only been a dream.
