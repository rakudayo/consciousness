I tried again to cause sleeping paralysis before going to bed yesterday. However, some sources say that night-time is the worst time because your body is primed to fall asleep. But I had my timer going, so I thought I would be okay.

I'm not sure when but my iPod Touch's battery died in the middle of the night. I was planning to wake at 4:30am and stay up for 45 minutes, then go back to sleep and try the timer method. The timer method is basically just waking yourself up and then sleeping again repeatedly using a timer. The key is not to move the body when waking up. This evidently wavers your body around the waking-sleeping threshold, confuse the body and induces waking sleep paralysis. Didn't work for me yet since my alarm clock (iPod Touch) died. :(

I'm try again now though.

Just woke up from sleeping a second time today with my wife.
Since I missed waking at the optimal time for OBEs (4:30-5:00am) this morning, I decided to try inducing sleep paralysis again while I was at least close. The session was pretty much normal one recommended in Lucidology 101 (http://www.lucidology.com/blog/category/lucidology-101/). The only differences were that I did not do the "roll" step of the stop-drop-roll method and I didn't have a timer. The reason for no timer is I didn't want to bother my wife.

Anyway, things progressed normally, and I could feel myself relaxing quite a bit. I tried a bit of all of the [techniques for speeding up sleep paralysis](http://www.lucidology.com/blog/79/sleep-commands/) described on Lucidology 101 (you will probably have to sign up for a free membership to view the above link. Only requires an email address).

However, I wasn't conscious of ever achieving 100% sleep paralysis. At some point I guess I drifted into real sleep and [experienced the dream described here](https://github.com/rakudayo/consciousness/blob/0c44a477f6b42e1327d356b10cebf22a5b2e798c/logs/dreamlog/201208.txt#L8-16).
