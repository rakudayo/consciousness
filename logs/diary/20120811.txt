08:13
I tried again to cause sleeping paralysis before going to bed yesterday.
However, some sources say that night-time is the worst time because your body is primed to fall asleep.
But I had my timer going, so I thought I would be okay.
I'm not sure when but my iPod Touch's battery died in the middle of the night.
I was planning to wake at 4:30am and stay up for 45 minutes, then go back to sleep and try the timer method.
The timer method is basically just waking yourself up and then sleeping again repeatedly using a timer.
The key is not to move the body when waking up.
This evidently wavers your body around the waking-sleeping threshold and induce waking sleep paralysis.
Didn't work for me yet since my alarm clock died.
I'm trying again now though.
