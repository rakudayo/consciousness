This morning I happened to be working late and didn't want to wake my wife who had to work early this morning. So I was sleeping on the floor in our living room (heated carpet under myself) with the usual brown blanket on top. I had a ceiling light on in the adjacent room, so the general lighting was pretty bright for sleeping. I was listening with headphones to a recording of some quiet relaxing whispers on repeat on my iPod.

At one point, I **became aware of the whispering on the recording** (this is the second time this method has proven effective), and I became lucid. I opened my eyes about halfway and start trying to move, but quickly realized that **my muscles would not respond**. So, I was staring up at a distant corner of the ceiling in my living room and, in true experimental spirit, I tried to imagine something frightening like a demon or ghost up in the corner, since I have heard that waking sleep paralysis can result in such frightening hallucinations, but nothing really happened. I **tried vigorously to move again to no avail**. This could be considered the strongest and most definite case of waking sleep paralysis that I have experienced yet.

All the while, the whispering recording was playing and I could hear the whispering words. I closed my eyes and still **felt a lightness that I have felt on several occasions where I have had an OBE**, so I tried to go with it. I attempted to relax and spin myself (in my mind) along the axis going up and down through my waist. I experienced myself rotate ever so slightly (perhaps 1 degree), and **felt as if I were pulling against some force trying to keep me in my body**. Simultaneously, I noticed that, as my "awareness" head began to leave the location of my "physical" head, I **perceived something like static interference or a breaking up in the recorded whisperings** [1]. I pushed harder and it felt that the pull increased equivalent to my efforts such that I felt stuck.

Finally, I gave up, opened my eyes again and realized I could move my body again, although a bit sluggishly.

[1] *It is worth noting that the recording I was listening to was made with high-quality stereo microphones and involved a person touching/rubbing the soft foamy part of the microphones during some parts of the recording. The resultant sound could have been what I was interpreting as static interference.*

I just got up from an afternoon nap in my living room. I slept on my floor much the same as last time, except no heated carpet under myself. I was again listening to whispering audio with the hopes that it would wake me up and make me lucid.

What I just experienced was very odd, as I'm starting to believe this stuff always is. I suddenly started to hear the voice in the recording whispering and was sort of lazily gazing up. I noticed the ceiling looked a bit strange and, again I had this sensation of having multiple eyelids and being able to see with multiple layers of eyes. I also had this odd feeling of being in the apartment of someone I knew but could not really connect who's apartment it was. The feeling didn't seem odd at the time. I also felt like I was not on the ground floor for some reason, but instead in a small, upstairs room. It was generally white.

After a moment, I realized that I had a spoon in my hand and started playing with bringing it into my view and out of my view, almost hypnotically. Then I realized that I shouldn't have a spoon and it started to fade out of my view. Then I focused on bringing it back into existence, which felt like it took more energy somehow to control what I saw in this place. The spoon faded in and out of view.

As I realized that I was controlling this (dream?), I felt a sudden rise of vibrations in my body. The sensation felt very much like it has in cases where I have had an OBE. I decided to try to exit and felt myself floating up out of my body from my stomach/abdomen first. I felt the vibrations stopping so opened my eyes and it seemed like I was immediately back in my body (in the dream apartment). I tried again with the same result.

What ensued was what felt like 3 to 4 minutes of struggling to first get out of my body, then struggling to actually move my body at all due to sleeping paralysis. I didn't feel scared, but I was very frustrated, pushing with all my force of will. As I struggled futilely to break my paralysis, I suddenly heard this creepy clown rap music playing over the whispering recording. At the same time I had this uneasy feeling that an intruder was coming up the stairs that were located behind my head out of view.

At one point I managed to get out of my body and immediately looked down at where I was sleeping to see if I could see my own body, but I only saw a pushed-aside blanket, which gave me the impression that I had woken up. Then I lay back down and was in sleeping paralysis again and the fighting to break paralysis continued.

Finally, I woke up and was able to move and immediately noticed that I was in a different room than the dream.

This experience was different from other OBEs that I've had in that I did not have a continuous stream of consciousness and I felt groggy when I finally woke up. It was most likely a lucid dream influenced heavily by the whispering recording (I could hear it throughout the dream, even when the weird rap music started) and my intense focusing on inducing OBEs recently. I have no idea how long I was asleep, but it was somewhere around 2 hours.

Again, I was lying on the floor in our living room and listening to whispering recordings while trying to fall sleep. At one point, I felt like I started to drift off and as soon as I did, the whisperings began to become intermixed with [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILsxr7j8tw4&t=0m21s). It was quite amazing because about ten seconds of the song played in high quality, as if it was also coming through my headphones.

I immediately started to feel some vibrations going through my body and, in my excitement, I tried to force myself out of my body. I felt as if I was exiting up out of the center of my back (I was lying on my stomach). As I felt I was exiting, I began to feel as if I was entering a club that the music is playing in. I even heard chatter and the clinking of glasses.

I then felt the same force I've felt before, like glue, pulling me back into my body and I woke up.
