This morning I happened to be working late and didn't want to wake my wife who had to work early this morning. So I was sleeping on the floor in our living room (heated blanket under myself) with the usual brown blanket on top. I had a ceiling light on in the adjacent room, so the general lighting was pretty bright for sleeping. I was listening with headphones to a recording of some quiet relaxing whispers on repeat on my iPod.

At one point, I **became aware of the whispering on the recording** (this is the second time this method has proven effective), and I became lucid. I opened my eyes about halfway and start trying to move, but quickly realized that **my muscles would not respond**. So, I was staring up at a distant corner of the ceiling in my living room and, in true experimental spirit, I tried to imagine something frightening like a demon or ghost up in the corner, since I have heard that waking sleep paralysis can result in such frightening hallucinations, but nothing really happened. I **tried vigorously to move again to no avail**. This could be considered the strongest and most definite case of waking sleep paralysis that I have experienced yet.

All the while, the whispering recording was playing and I could hear the whispering words. I closed my eyes and still **felt a lightness that I have felt on several occasions where I have had an OBE**, so I tried to go with it. I attempted to relax and spin myself (in my mind) along the axis going up and down through my waist. I experienced myself rotate ever so slightly (perhaps 1 degree), and **felt as if I were pulling against some force trying to keep me in my body**. Simultaneously, I noticed that, as my "awareness" head began to leave the location of my "physical" head, I **perceived something like static interference or a breaking up in the recorded whisperings** [1]. I pushed harder and it felt that the pull increased equivalent to my efforts such that I felt stuck.

Finally, I gave up, opened my eyes again and realized I could move my body again, although a bit sluggishly.

[1] *It is worth noting that the recording I was listening to was made with high-quality stereo microphones and involved a person touching/rubbing the soft foamy part of the microphones during some parts of the recording. The resultant sound could have been what I was interpreting as static interference.*
