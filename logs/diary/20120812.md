14:49
I slept from about 06:30 this morning until about 12:00, woke up for about 10 minutes then slept again until 14:00.
When lying down the first time, my only sleep-related goal was to remember my dreams, which I achieved.
The second time I slept, I put on earbud headphones and had a cyclic 15-minute timer running.
My goal was to try to induce hypnotic fractionation by repeatedly sleeping and waking up.
However, after about three rings of the timer, I was still awake having not slept one.
I felt very uncomfortable in what I can only describe as partial sleep paralysis.
My body just felt heavy, while my mind refused to sleep.
I think that I am still too excited about the whole OBE idea and its potential.
So my mind has a difficult time relaxing into lower-level brainwave patterns.
So I gave up, removed the headphones and just slept.
On the plus side, I had a good amount of dream recall this time.
