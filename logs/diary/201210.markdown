I just had another experience that I think could have been an OBE. It was short and after waking the time was about what I expected it to be if I had had continuous consciousness (less than 20 minutes since I slept). The experience was very strange. I suppose it could have been a dream, since I wasn't able to verify anything learned during the OBE, but the sensations felt more real than any dream I can remember experiencing.

I lie down in bed next to my wife as usual, the only difference was that I set my arms to my sides and just started trying to sleep (not consciously trying for an OBE). After a few minutes my awareness/consciousness dimmed to where I was almost asleep, then I started to feel my body vibrating. Almost instantly, I became lucid again and could feel my body vibration as it had done before on two other occasions. I also noted that I could hear our fan that was one in the room, but it sounds more like sand being shaken around in a paper bag.

My first instinct was to wake up, and I opened my eyes and started trying to move my body and make a sound, but nothing moved except my eyelids. Again, I wish I had continued to try to break the sleep paralysis so that I could verify that I was paralyzed (I almost certainly was). Next time I will continue to try to break the paralysis until I can move again with continuous consciousness.

But this time, I gave up and closed my eyes and focused on relaxing my body, which I have heard is helpful in getting "past" the vibrations. As I relaxed, I had the sensation of starting to float, like I was rising up a bit, yet still in or connected to my physical body. So then I tried the cap twist exit technique that I have read about. I focused on rotating my body around so that my head would be at my feet and my feet would be at my head, but somehow I got off center and I could feel my legs going through our wall. It was a strange sensation, feeling the wall yet being inside it. I would say I felt the wall more like a vibration or energy.

Then I pulled my legs back into the bedroom and floated up about 2-3 feet, still looking upwards. At this time I realized that if I was in an OBE, all I had to do was think of someone or something and I would be teleported there instantly. So I tried thinking of my brother, but nothing happened. I remember looking up at the window in my bedroom (has curtains over it) and thinking how odd it looked. The whole room was dark and hard to see, but it was almost like seeing moonlight through the window, but that is not possible to see. Or possibly, it was list the light coming through the curtains was swirly.

After noting how the window and curtains looked strange, I thought I wanted to wake and tell my wife about this. Then I was instantly back in my body and waking up. I woke up my wife to tell her (I wasn't groggy at all). She listened politely, but was slightly irritated at being woken up at 3am.

The whole time since lying down and getting up took between 20-25 minutes.

It has been over a month since I seriously logged in this diary. I will continue to investigate and see what I can determine about this phenomenon.
