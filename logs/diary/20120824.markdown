#### 23:00
This morning, from around 08:30 to 12:00, I tried to do the Wake-Back-to-Sleep OBE induction method.
This time I was able to forget about having the earbuds in and actually fall asleep, except I slept through most of the 3 hours MP3 which had periodic beeps.
I turned down the volume of the beeps midway because they were startling me and I felt myself jump a bit.
After turning them down, they stopped startling me, but I guess the volume was too low because eventually I fell asleep and woke up 3 hours later.
No luck today, but at least I got some practice in.
I guess I need to keep the volume a bit louder and get to the point where I don't get startled by it.
