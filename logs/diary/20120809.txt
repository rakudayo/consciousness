Today I began again to rekindle my interest in altered states of consciousness. I would like to start my own, unbiased, skeptical research into this area. Specifically, I'm interested in the claims made by practitioners of:
- Lucid Dreaming
- OBEs (Out of Body Experiences)
- Astral Projection
- Remote Viewing
- Energy Sciences

Below is what I plan to do to further investigation into Lucid Dreaming:

LUCID DREAMING
- Keep a dream log at ~/Play/Consciousness/logs/dreamlog
  - Write the date down before sleeping
  - Note everything I can remember about the dreams I had
  - Note is a special place those things which are recurrences in my dreams
- Many times a day, perform the same two "reality checks" 
  - Checking if my palms look normal when looking closely at them.
  - Checking if I can push two fingers through the palm of my right hand.

One final note I want to mention today is the necessity for cultivating fearlessness. As long as I am afraid of what I might experience in higher levels of consciousness, fear will cause my mind to retreat into the safety of normal waking consciousness and hinder my efforts. It may seem frightening to encounter dark, potentially malevolent entities, but I must be prepared to face them without fear lest I allow fear to hinder my goals of discovery. 

I believe that humanity is in dire need of something new, a new paradigm to allow us to overcome our fundamental inadequacies, and I hope that something discovered on this journey will be a useful tool for guiding humanity to a higher, more purposeful and virtuous existence.
I believe that keeping such a sincere purpose close to my heart will protect me from any danger which may attract to me. This mission is greater than myself and I cannot let fear stand in the way.

What I log in these diaries will be my actual perceived experiences only, without embellishment, without falsification of any kind. 
However, it will be important to distinguish between what my mind may have created and what actually happens.
