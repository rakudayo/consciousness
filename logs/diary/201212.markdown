I just had a very strange Out-of-Body Experience (OBE). It was incredibly vivid and definitely _not_ like any dream I have ever experienced.

I was lying down on the couch-bed in our living room next to my wife who was already asleep. She was on the right and I was next to a wall on the left. I wore a navy sweatshirt with blue t-shirt underneath, and navy sweatpants, along with a heavy futon (Japanese winter blanket) and inner fuzzy blanket, so I was _very_ warm. After about an hour I woke up once from the alarm clock, walked over to the alarm clock and reset it, then went back to bed.

For some reason, I was lying with my eyes closed and daydreaming about having an out of body experience. I was imagining what it might feel like to only have my energy body move around (i.e. my physical body completely still, yet still experiencing the sensation of movement through the world). Then, I can't recall why, but I began thinking of an image of some kind of device, it reminded me of a cassette tape (a horizontally-long rectangle with two large circles side-by-side inside of it). Not a lot of detail as the image seemed to rise up out of the different shades of darkness in the black visual space behind my eyelids. 

Then instead of falling asleep as I expected, suddenly I felt almost as if my body were falling, and the **vibrations that I've mentioned before sort of rose up around me and rapidly became very strong**. I also **noticed auditory phenomena** that made me feel like I was somehow wearing headphones or something. I tried first relaxing a bit and the vibrations continued to get stronger, then I decided to try and get up as I usually do in this situation, which is to get up, put my arms over my wife's body, and push my legs up and sort of jump over her. I felt my upper body rise up over my bed, wrap around/above my wife on my right side, and gently start floating down like a feather, my legs still felt stuck in my body. So lying with my lower body draped over my wife and my back resting on the floor, I tried to pull my legs out of my body. I felt like I was being successful (however, I'm almost certain I was transported back into my body).

I then wondered what my body looked like in this state, so I raised my left arm. It was completely translucent, and I could see the ceiling of my apartment through it. I also noted that it looked a bit thinner or smaller than my hand usually looked or perhaps further away than usual, although it was difficult to make out the edges since it was so translucent. I also noted that my arm cast a much stronger shadow on the left wall in my field of view (this is how I knew I must have been moved back in the locality of my physical body somehow). Then I noticed that for some odd reason only my left eye was open, so I opened my right eye also and my field of view broadened. At this point, I noticed I was indeed back in the location of my physical body.

I started to push as hard as I could to try and separate again, but it felt as if I was stuck and I kept falling back into myself. I knew I wasn't making progress and didn't want to risk waking up my body, so I relaxed back into my body and decided to try an exit technique I read about called 'the corkscrew'. However, I soon heard sounds of struggling or whimpering coming from my wife's direction, so I decided to end my experience and see if she was okay (I thought I must be bothering her). I started consciously **trying to move my physical body to no avail**, so I tried making a groan which I was successful at. Shortly thereafter, I was able to begin moving my body again.

Numerous times during my perceived struggling to escape the physical, I had the sensation that I might possibly be moving a part of my physical body, however when I woke up, the body felt very much like I had not moved it for a while. Also my wife was quietly sleeping next to me. My muscles were very relaxed and drained of energy, **yet my mind was sharp and alert, very unlike when I usually wake up from sleep**.

Many questions remain after this experience. What was it about this experience that caused me to have these vibrations so strongly and quickly? What are the vibrations and what are their purpose? Why was I not able to easily separate from my body? And most disturbingly, what were the struggling, frantic sounds I heard coming from my wife? It is worth noting that, again, I did not try to see my physical body and I did not directly perceive my wife's body either, even when I felt I was draped over her. Next time I will try to see my own body. I hope that soon I can more easily master movement and perception in the OBE state.

Lastly, it is worth noting that throughout the whole experience, I never once lost consciousness or fell asleep. From the time I lie down until I shook myself out of sleep paralysis, I had a continuous stream of consciousness. This was also my **first verifiable experience of waking sleep paralysis**.

(UPDATE: After my wife woke up, she told me she had a very frightening and violent dream. It's difficult to determine whether the dream was at the exact time of my OBE or not, but it could explain the troubled sounds I heard coming from her.)

I awoke this morning feeling sick with what feels like a sinus infection. I am in Midori-shi, my wife's hometown in Gunma prefecture, Japan, for Oshougatsu, the Japanese celebration of the new year. I awoke and went back to bed repeatedly due to coughing up phlegm.

While I was lying down about 20 minutes ago, I was looking at the wall and the blue sky was showing through the curtain over the window. As I lazily gazed at the scene, I had this sense that only one or neither of my eyes were open. Also, the "viewing" seemed rather similar to my experience [on this date](https://github.com/rakudayo/consciousness/blob/master/logs/diary/201212.markdown#20121215). Since this confused me, I tried opening my eyes and saw the scene change, as I opened my physical eyes and actually saw the wall and window. I immediately became aware that I must have been seeing with some other eye(s).

Then suddenly **brief vibrations flashed through through my body** and I had the sensation of being pulled into the scene, through the window curtains (although I didn't feel them) and into a brilliant blue sky with white clouds. The scene I was looking at now was much more vivid than before, as if I was watching a video in DVD quality.

I then saw at least three objects spread out before me with the blue sky as a backdrop and these objects were presented one after another:

- A brochure (or possibly a book) with the big words "Psychic Reading" written across the top and a phone number I unfortunately couldn't read fast enough. It was a very colorful brochure, with lots of gold, purple and blue on the cover.
- I cannot remember what this was.
- An incomplete map of what seemed to be the central US with a few cities labeled. I thought I could make out Tennessee's shape on there. I remember seeing at least two cities called "Tate" marked on the map and one further north labeled "Naomi".

Then suddenly I was transported to a parking lot outside of a small grocery store. I saw the parking lot first as if I was flying above it, making a long circle. The scene before me looked as if it were paused. There were cars scattered throughout the parking lot, and I remember thinking maybe there is something bad going to happen here, like a terrorist attack or some other kind of tragedy. (Note: This thought felt completely my own, not as if I was receiving it from anywhere.)

I then noticed saw what looked like a ring of cars side-by-side with the hoods pointing inward, with an explosion in the center and a car being propelled upward from the explosion. The scene appeared as if it were paused.

I then was transported closer to the grocery story, where I saw the windows covered with product advertisements (for example, 3 kiwis for $3). I began to hurriedly search for any clues I could find as to the date or location, assuming this experience would end soon, but to no avail. I considered going inside and trying to find someone to ask. 

However, I was then transported back to the location of the ring of cars I saw before, but it was not the same scene any longer. It looked structurally similar, a ring of vehicles with something suspended up above in the center, but this time there was some kind of construction crane suspending a bunch of huge medieval weapons, such as swords, halberds, pikes, etc, above the middle of the vehicles.

At this point, I **felt a thought come to me from my right side that didn't seem entirely my own**. It said that I had 11 seconds to do something. For some reason, I interpreted that something as climbing up the crane to get into the bundle of medieval weapons. Perhaps this was the wrong conclusion, because I was instantly back in my bedroom opening my eyes.

This experience was unlike any other I've had thus far in that I was not where I went to sleep and **the locality was unknown to me**. I also didn't feel I had completely free movement, but it felt more like I was being moved about by some other power. I also have the impression that **my own thoughts were much more obviously shaping my reality** in this place, much like a lucid dream. But I did feel that information of some form was flowing to me, perhaps with the assistance of someone, and I was just coloring it with my own preconceptions and thoughts (first the explosion, then the suspended medieval weapons, which were probably related to a recent trip I took to Europe where I saw such implements of war).

(Update: After a bit of research, there does seem to be places called "Tate" in Georgia, Mississippi, Ohio and Arkansas. I couldn't find any towns named Naomi however.)
