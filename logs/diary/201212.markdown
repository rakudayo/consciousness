I just had a very strange Out-of-Body Experience (OBE). It was incredibly vivid and definitely _not_ like any dream I have ever experienced.

I was lying down on the couch-bed in our living room next to my wife who was already asleep. She was on the right and I was next to a wall on the left. I wore a navy sweatshirt with blue t-shirt underneath, and navy sweatpants, along with a heavy futon (Japanese winter blanket) and inner fuzzy blanket, so I was _very_ warm. After about an hour I woke up once from the alarm clock, walked over to the alarm clock and reset it, then went back to bed.

For some reason, I was lying with my eyes closed and daydreaming about having an out of body experience. I was imagining what it might feel like to only have my energy body move around (i.e. my physical body completely still, yet still experiencing the sensation of movement through the world). Then, I can't recall why, but I began thinking of an image of some kind of device, it reminded me of a cassette tape (a horizontally-long rectangle with two large circles side-by-side inside of it). Not a lot of detail as the image seemed to rise up out of the different shades of darkness in the black visual space behind my eyelids. 

Then instead of falling asleep as I expected, suddenly I felt almost as if my body were falling, and the **vibrations that I've mentioned before sort of rose up around me and rapidly became very strong**. I also **noticed auditory phenomena** that made me feel like I was somehow wearing headphones or something. I tried first relaxing a bit and the vibrations continued to get stronger, then I decided to try and get up as I usually do in this situation, which is to get up, put my arms over my wife's body, and push my legs up and sort of jump over her. I felt my upper body rise up over my bed, wrap around/above my wife on my right side, and gently start floating down like a feather, my legs still felt stuck in my body. So lying with my lower body draped over my wife and my back resting on the floor, I tried to pull my legs out of my body. I felt like I was being successful (however, I'm almost certain I was transported back into my body).

I then wondered what my body looked like in this state, so I raised my left arm. It was completely translucent, and I could see the ceiling of my apartment through it. I also noted that it looked a bit thinner or smaller than my hand usually looked or perhaps further away than usual, although it was difficult to make out the edges since it was so translucent. I also noted that my arm cast a much stronger shadow on the left wall in my field of view (this is how I knew I must have been moved back in the locality of my physical body somehow). Then I noticed that for some odd reason only my left eye was open, so I opened my right eye also and my field of view broadened. At this point, I noticed I was indeed back in the location of my physical body.

I started to push as hard as I could to try and separate again, but it felt as if I was stuck and I kept falling back into myself. I knew I wasn't making progress and didn't want to risk waking up my body, so I relaxed back into my body and decided to try an exit technique I read about called 'the corkscrew'. However, I soon heard sounds of struggling or whimpering coming from my wife's direction, so I decided to end my experience and see if she was okay (I thought I must be bothering her). I started consciously **trying to move my physical body to no avail**, so I tried making a groan which I was successful at. Shortly thereafter, I was able to begin moving my body again.

Numerous times during my perceived struggling to escape the physical, I had the sensation that I might possibly be moving a part of my physical body, however when I woke up, the body felt very much like I had not moved it for a while. Also my wife was quietly sleeping next to me. My muscles were very relaxed and drained of energy, **yet my mind was sharp and alert, very unlike when I usually wake up from sleep**.

Many questions remain after this experience. What was it about this experience that caused me to have these vibrations so strongly and quickly? What are the vibrations and what are their purpose? Why was I not able to easily separate from my body? And most disturbingly, what were the struggling, frantic sounds I heard coming from my wife? It is worth noting that, again, I did not try to see my physical body and I did not directly perceive my wife's body either, even when I felt I was draped over her. Next time I will try to see my own body. I hope that soon I can more easily master movement and perception in the OBE state.

Lastly, it is worth noting that throughout the whole experience, I never once lost consciousness or fell asleep. From the time I lie down until I shook myself out of sleep paralysis, I had a continuous stream of consciousness. This was also my **first verifiable experience of waking sleep paralysis**.

(UPDATE: After my wife woke up, she told me she had a very frightening and violent dream. It's difficult to determine whether the dream was at the exact time of my OBE or not, but it could explain the troubled sounds I heard coming from her.)
