It has been a while since I tried to induce an Out of Body Experience. Let's face it, I've been lazy. I've also been trying to get my sleeping rhythm back on track for more effective inductions. That is, no longer going to bed at 3am, but instead going to bed at 10pm and waking around 4am. My current sleep rhythm is sleeping around midnight and waking at 7am.

Another thing to note is that I'm using Sleep Cycle, an iPhone app, to try to monitor how frequently I go into REM (Deep) sleep as an effort to monitor the quality of my sleep. Basically, you just put your phone on the bed and each time you move, it detects that via the accelerometer. The makers of the app use the fact that we do not move during REM sleep to identify REM sleep periods.

Another useful point about Sleep Cycle is that when you are woken up in the deepest REM sleep you are very groggy, your mind is cloudy, and it is difficult to function well for at least 30 minutes (although you tend to remember your dreams more). The opposite is true as well though. If you wake in the lightest levels of sleep, you feel fresh and revitalized. Sleep Cycle allows you to set an alarm with a 30 minute window in which it will awaken you during your lightest sleep cycle. I have another app, called dREaM Alarm, which tries to do the opposite and wake you up in REM sleep, so that you can have better dream recall.

One last thing to mention regarding my usage of Sleep Cycle is that I sleep with my wife together on the same bed. Although the device is closest to me, he movements probably cause some noise/interference and I do not see smooth results usually. I generally have not felt particularly "fresh" and "lively" when I've been woken up, but I feel a bit more clarity that usual.

Anyway, this afternoon, I tried again to induce sleep paralysis in myself using the timer method. I was able to fall asleep once or twice, but then had difficulty getting back to sleep. The whole session lasted about 1 hour after which I woke up and am writing this record.
