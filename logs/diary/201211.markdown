I just woke up after sleeping about 20 minutes just before I had a very strange experience. I was listening to a relaxing video on youtube of someone whispering while I slept.

For some reason I became aware of the whisperings and of the fact that I was lying down, however I realized that I couldn't see clearly (it was very dark). Then I remembered that I had laid down to sleep and thought, "I should become aware!"

Then I suddenly had this sensation of moving (or rather being sucked) down into my body. The movement sensation only lasted about 1 second, after which I had this sensation of my body vibrating as has happened before. My mental state was quite excited, and the vibrations stopped after two or three seconds. Almost immediately I tested trying to move my body and it was a bit sluggish, but I did not feel any paralysis.
