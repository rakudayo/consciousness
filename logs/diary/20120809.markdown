Today I began again to rekindle my interest in altered states of consciousness.
I would like to start my own skeptical, objective research into this area.
Specifically, I'm interested in the claims made by practitioners of:

* Lucid Dreaming
* OBEs (Out of Body Experiences)
* Astral Projection
* Remote Viewing
* Energy Medicine

A few such claims that I have come across are:

* During a medical surgery to remove an aneurysm from her brain, a woman named Pam Reynolds [claims to have experienced leaving her body and observing the operating room](http://www.near-death.com/experiences/evidence01.html). Although she was dead by all three standard scientific measures during the surgery, she was able to describe events which occurred with startling accuracy.
* Youtube user Jevixdluv [claims to have seen things happening many miles away that was later corroborated by family](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RRlcTxJFOE). She experienced her mind traveling a far distance from her resting physical location to view a little girl she knew at her church who was walking down a hallway with a towel wrapped around her. Later, when she talked to her family member who was at the church, he said that the child had wet herself and they have to wrap a towel around her.
* Youtube user yuttadhammo [claims to have seen an event occur before it actually happened](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSBat65EtE). He claims to have seen his brother downstairs pouring a cereal and knocking it over, then when he woke and went downstairs he watched his brother pour a bowl of cereal, turn around and knock it over in the same manner as his premonition.
* ...and many more.

The key thing to keep in mind here is just because people claim something, doesn't make it true. I am interested in seeing if it is possible for me to experience something equivalent to what the above people claim.

Below is what I plan to do to further investigate:

1. Keep a dream log
  - Write the date down before sleeping
  - Note everything I can remember about the dreams I had
  - Note is a special place those things which are recurrences in my dreams
2. Many times a day, perform the same two "reality checks" 
  - Checking if my palms look normal when looking closely at them.
  - Checking if I can push two fingers through the palm of my right hand.
3. Try the method described in Lucidology 101 at  [Lucidology.com](http://www.lucidology.com/) for inducing lucid dreams and OBEs using sleep paralysis
  - First milestone: Experience full-body sleep paralysis
  - Second miletone: Experience an OBE
  - Third milestone: Verify the OBE is not only in my head. For example, have my wife place a playing card face-up on our kitchen table and then "observe" it via an OBE from our bedroom.

One final note I want to mention today is the necessity for cultivating fearlessness.
As long as I am afraid of what I might experience in higher levels of consciousness, fear will cause my mind to retreat into the safety of normal waking consciousness and hinder my efforts. 
It may seem frightening to encounter dark, potentially malevolent entities, but I must be prepared to face them without fear lest I allow fear to hinder my goals of discovery. 

I believe that humanity is in desperate need of something new, a new paradigm, to allow us to overcome our fundamental inadequacies.
I hope that something discovered on this journey might be helpful in guiding humanity to a higher, more purposeful and peaceful existence.
I believe that keeping such a sincere purpose close to my heart will protect me from any danger which may attract to me.
This mission is greater than myself and I will face any fear necessary.

What I log in these diaries will be my actual perceived experiences, without embellishment, without falsification of any kind.
I will try to always separate myself from what I would like to believe and from what I know to be true.
For this reason, it will be important to distinguish between what my mind may have created and what actually happens to me.
