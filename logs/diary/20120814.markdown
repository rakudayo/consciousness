I just tried again today to induce an OBE.
This time I played the [lucidology-101-rhythm-napping-timer-ramp-2-minute-base-73-mins.mp3]() timer on my laptop and lay down in my bedroom.
I left a lamp on so that the room would not be too dark and I could relax.

I did the stop-drop-roll method and ended rolled over on my right-side.
after rolling over on my right side, I stopped moving.
One thing I should note is that before doing this, I ate a plate of soba (Japanese buckwheat noodles).
After about 45 minutes, while lying on my right side my stomach started growling a whole lot which was distracting.

I really start to lose a sense of time when I do this stuff.
However, I believe I was conscious the entire time.
The beeping is startling me a bit less, but I was not ever asleep.
I think my mind may be too alert perhaps? Not sure.
When I stopped, by entire body felt like jello, but I could still move all limbs.

One additional thing worth noting is that, after waking up, my right leg is quite itchy and a bit of my left leg also.
This is the second time I've noticed this reaction after trying to induce an OBE.
My skin has some very small bumps that are itchy.
I will need to keep an eye on this.
