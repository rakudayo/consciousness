I tried again to do the timer method (repeatedly sleeping and waking up with the assistance of a cyclic timer in order to induce sleeping paralysis). I lay down on the floor on my left side in our living room with a pillow and earbud headphones one connected to my iPod that has the timer.

The first beep woke me up, actually caused me to jump a bit, then I don't think I even heard subsequent beeps. After some amount of time I'm not aware of (felt like about 30 minutes), I woke up without moving and felt my body in a very relaxed state, although it sort of hurt in some areas as if my body was begging me to move.

I decided to give up for the evening and started to move my leg, and was unable to move my left foot. It felt as if it were completely asleep and I just thought that circulation to that food must have been constricted, since I was sleeping on my left side and it was under my other foot.

It gradually started to wake up and I was able to move it again. However, the entire reawakening was absent of the uncomfortable, prickly feeling of circulation returning to a limb that has fallen asleep. So I can only conclude that my foot did not fall asleep, but was actually under sleep paralysis!

This is a big milestone, since I've now been able to induce full sleep paralysis in one of my limbs. Now I feel I am making progress. Next milestone - full body sleep paralysis!
