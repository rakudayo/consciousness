#### 14:52
I just woke up from an afternoon nap and I felt very real vibrations!
I think I was close to having an OBE.

I had been out working at a Starbucks earlier today and stopped to have Indian for lunch.
I work from home so am able to freely adjust my work hours how I like.
Anyway, so I suddenly felt incredibly gassy and uncomfortable, so I decided to go home and take a nap.

I lay down on my left side and just fell asleep to take a normal nap.
At some point, I felt myself awake.
I guess that the recent practice with the timer method has caused me to be more calm when I awake and generally interested in experiencing those waking moments without moving.
So I did not immediately move.
Instead I was aware of my eyes slightly twitching up and down rapidly.
I focused my attention on trying to still them, because recently this has felt like it has helped we enter deeper sleep paralysis.

Shortly thereafter, I experienced the black background of my eyelids gradually transition into static, almost as if my nose were touching an analog television tuned to a non-existent channel, but the static wasn't blurry as it would be in that case, but instead crystal clear.

In unison with the static visual stimuli, I began to feel vibrations happening through my whole body (and some accompanying noise, but my focused attention was unfortunately more on the visual stimuli).
The closest thing I can compare the vibrations to was being in a massage chair [like this one](https://github.com/rakudayo/consciousness/blob/master/logs/resources/ep30005brownrecline.jpg?raw=true) when the entire chair was vibrating, except the chair actually covered the top of my body also.

As the vibrations got stronger, I decided that this was enough for the first experience (I tend to like to experience things in baby steps), so I started to crack open my eyes.
It seems like normal when I crack open your eyes, even my vision was a bit blurry from my eyelashes.
I started to try to move my body gently, but nothing else moved.
That is when I realized I was in waking sleep paralysis.
In retrospect, I wish that I had tried more vigorously to move my body at this time to determine if I was really in full sleep paralysis.
However, I assumed I was and that it would be boring to just lay there and possibly have bad hallucinations, so I closed my eyes again and started to relax.

The visual static and vibrations came back again almost immediately.
This time I tried to "push through" the static, although I'm not sure what they meant.
I just felt a directional sense and pushed in the direction I thought would get me through.
(I've heard you shouldn't do this, as it just wastes your energy, but I had the egotistical thought that "I'm somehow special, I have plenty of energy.")
I felt the vibrations getting stronger and felt like I was pushing slowly through at half or a third the normal movement rate through this medium.
It felt like pushing again an elastic net or cobweb, the way it would stretch, except I was actually making it through (I felt).

Anyway, from this point on I have a strong feeling I was dreaming.
I remember the static giving way to a scene that looked similar to how Neo see the matrix at the end of the matrix (but not green, it was more graytoned).
I heard this voice that said something that I could hear at the time, but cannot remember now.
I do remember seeing a still, cartoony image of a thin old man without any shirt on pulling some stream of red out of something else off the edge of the cartoon frame.
The old man was saying, "Out you go!"
Then I had a conversation with this old man.
He struck me as the kind of really intelligent character who talks to himself a lot.
He said something about having to stay on our toes for the second war when it comes.
I remember asking him, "There's been a first war?"
Then he looked at me and I was back in my body waking up.

On the plus side, I don't feel gassy anymore.
