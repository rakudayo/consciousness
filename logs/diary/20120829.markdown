#### 12:36
This morning, around 08:30, I went back to bed since I had only slept about 4 hours last night.

I first tried about 45 minutes to use the timer method on the couch in our living room. I did fall asleep and was woken numerous times by the timer. However, no strange feelings occurred.

At about 09:15, I decided to give up for today and went to my bedroom to sleep next to my wife. I'm unsure what time this occurred, but I suddenly because aware of what I thought was the ceiling of my bedroom. However, there appeared to be a shape almost like the outline of a large shark bending its body in mid-swim. It was frozen in place but I got this feeling I was on the bottom of an ocean looking up at the surface.

Then I had two rapid thoughts. First, what am I doing at the bottom of the ocean when I was just sleeping in my bedroom? Second, this must be a dream brought on by the movie I watched on youtube last night about extreme super-Earths that are completely covered by water.

Immediately, I became awake (or extremely lucid). I opened my eyes and realized that I **could not move my body at all**. I remember thinking that the room was becoming darker, feeling a bit of fear set in. The room did seem to get darker, as if there was a dark cloud settling over me. Then I forced myself to think of a cute, fluffy kitten walking across my chest. After I started thinking of fluffy kittens, I didn't see any, but I did calm down and the fear and darkness seemed to recede.

I then focused on changing my breathing patterns, which seemed to help me un-paralyze. After regaining movement, I remember looking over next to me and seeing my sleeping wife, then closing my eyes again and repeating in my head something like, "God, show me who you are. I want to know you." I think the reason I felt I should say these words is that the previous night I had watched [this man's account of his NDE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6va_5Wf2Pc) (Near Death Experience). What struck me is the surprising simplicity of what he says God told him he should do to avoid the lonely place he called Hell: "Get to know me."

After I said this, I felt this **pleasant pulse of warm vibrational energy** (that is the best I can describe the sensation) that seemed to strengthen in the back of my head and shower or fall through my body in a wave lasting about 3-5 seconds. I have this feeling sometimes, quite often recently, when I listen to a song or watch a movie that evokes a strong emotional response in me or sometimes just by breathing deeply and contemplating the idea that I might be more than just my physical body. I should also comment that this was very different from the vibrations I experienced earlier this month on Aug 15th.

Also, at some point I noticed I heard these **rushing sounds**, like a strong wind blowing into my ears, but sort of interrupted periodically by silence. It rather sounded like the wind was blowing at me in irregular, periodic rushes. I have heard that these sounds are precursors to OBEs, but I didn't expect to hear these sounds in any way, as I didn't think I was anywhere close to an OBE.

After I felt the warm energetic wave, I continued to lay there for a bit until I guess I fell asleep (or lost lucidity).

Finally, I want to emphasize that I cannot be 100% objectively sure that this experience of sleep paralysis did not just happen in a very lucid dream instead of the actual physical (waking) world, since I went to sleep shortly after. I do think it is likely I woke up while still in sleep paralysis, but to be 100% sure, I need to shake myself out of the paralysis, then wake up immediately after and maintain continuity of consciousness. I want to be as rigorous as possible in verifying these feelings/experiences are not just figments of my own imagination.
