Today I began again to rekindle my interest in altered states of consciousness.
I would like to start my own skeptical, objective research into this area.
Specifically, I'm interested in the claims made by practitioners of:

* Lucid Dreaming
* OBEs (Out of Body Experiences)
* Astral Projection
* Remote Viewing
* Energy Medicine

A few such claims that I have come across are:

* During a medical surgery to remove an aneurysm from her brain, a woman named Pam Reynolds [claims to have experienced leaving her body and observing the operating room](http://www.near-death.com/experiences/evidence01.html). Although she was dead by all three standard scientific measures during the surgery, she was able to describe events which occurred with startling accuracy.
* Youtube user Jevixdluv [claims to have seen things happening many miles away that was later corroborated by family](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RRlcTxJFOE). She experienced her mind traveling a far distance from her resting physical location to view a little girl she knew at her church who was walking down a hallway with a towel wrapped around her. Later, when she talked to her family member who was at the church, he said that the child had wet herself and they have to wrap a towel around her.
* Youtube user yuttadhammo [claims to have seen an event occur before it actually happened](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSBat65EtE). He claims to have seen his brother downstairs pouring a cereal and knocking it over, then when he woke and went downstairs he watched his brother pour a bowl of cereal, turn around and knock it over in the same manner as his premonition.
* ...and many more.

The key thing to keep in mind here is just because people claim something, doesn't make it true. I am interested in seeing if it is possible for me to experience something equivalent to what the above people claim.

Below is what I plan to do to further investigate:

1. Keep a dream log
  - Write the date down before sleeping
  - Note everything I can remember about the dreams I had
  - Note is a special place those things which are recurrences in my dreams
2. Many times a day, perform the same two "reality checks" 
  - Checking if my palms look normal when looking closely at them.
  - Checking if I can push two fingers through the palm of my right hand.
3. Try the method described in Lucidology 101 at  [Lucidology.com](http://www.lucidology.com/) for inducing lucid dreams and OBEs using sleep paralysis
  - First milestone: Experience full-body sleep paralysis
  - Second miletone: Experience an OBE
  - Third milestone: Verify the OBE is not only in my head. For example, have my wife place a playing card face-up on our kitchen table and then "observe" it via an OBE from our bedroom.

One final note I want to mention today is the necessity for cultivating fearlessness.
As long as I am afraid of what I might experience in higher levels of consciousness, fear will cause my mind to retreat into the safety of normal waking consciousness and hinder my efforts. 
It may seem frightening to encounter dark, potentially malevolent entities, but I must be prepared to face them without fear lest I allow fear to hinder my goals of discovery. 

I believe that humanity is in desperate need of something new, a new paradigm, to allow us to overcome our fundamental inadequacies.
I hope that something discovered on this journey might be helpful in guiding humanity to a higher, more purposeful and peaceful existence.
I believe that keeping such a sincere purpose close to my heart will protect me from any danger which may attract to me.
This mission is greater than myself and I will face any fear necessary.

What I log in these diaries will be my actual perceived experiences, without embellishment, without falsification of any kind.
I will try to always separate myself from what I would like to believe and from what I know to be true.
For this reason, it will be important to distinguish between what my mind may have created and what actually happens to me.

#### 00:30
Earlier at 22:45 yesterday, I tried to induce an OBE.
I lay down on the sofa in my living room, pointed a fan at my head and tried not to move.
My legs were out straight and apart.
I lay on my back and my hands were on my stomach.

I lay there for about 10-15 minutes with my eyes closed and trying to relax my body, then I think I actually fell asleep.
However, some unknown span of time later, I drifted back into consciousness.
I did not move after coming back into consciousness.
I continued to lay there another 30-45 minutes, observing how my body felt.
Multiple times I felt a tingling sensation in my hands, almost like gentle vibrations.
The tingling sensation was very different than the unpleasant, prickly feeling of a sleeping appendage waking up.
In the middle, I felt my body being weighed down almost entirely up to my node/mouth.
My jaw was sagging down and I felt some difficulty breathing.
It felt like my chin might be sagging and constricting my throat.
So, in an attempt to resolve the breathing difficulty, I moved the top of my head a bit over the edge of the sofa.
This elevated my chin and made the breathing less difficult, but required me to move my entire body.

The entire time, the heavy, lack of feeling sensation only ever came as high as my mouth.
I had to constantly expend mental effort to relax my eyes and keep them from moving around.
Two or three times, I felt that on the other side of my eyelids the light was brightening.
However, I didn't open my eyes to check though.
No detectable OBE today.

#### 02:49
I'm not sleepy at all.
I watched some youtube videos by [Lucidology.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgJOMqIhvHM&playnext=1&list=PL9B7E58F670282B45).
Evidently, I made the below mistakes when I tried my OBE last time:

1. I put my hands on my stomach instead of beside my body. 
Putting hands on your stomach seems to be an implicit signal to the body that the mind is still awake.
2. I must keep my body completely still
3. Doing the "Stop, drop and roll" method could help
4. Also, trying early in the morning (4:30-5:00) instead of at night would align better with the body's circadian rhythm and seratonin/cortisol levels would be more conducive to sustained alertness.

#### 10:50
I tried to induce an OBE again.
Almost fell asleep once, then I really did.
Good thing I set my alarm, otherwise I would have missed a lunch I scheduled.
I was startled when the alarm woke me and felt no sleep paralysis.
I should try to wake myself up with an alarm, not move at all, then lie still, alert and see if sleep paralysis occurs.

#### 14:30ish
I tried this time to induce simple "waking sleep paralysis", instead of a full-blown OBE. Waking sleep paralysis is supposedly sort of the launching pad for OBEs. It is a state in which the body has fallen asleep, but the mind is still awake. In sleep paralysis, the body has actually paralyzed itself to keep a person from acting out his or her dreams.

From what I've read, most people enter sleep paralysis every a night, they just do not realize it is because their conscious mind is asleep also.
It can be very frightening when people awaken and they are still experiencing sleep paralysis. Awakening to find your body paralyzed and being unable to breath well, as if a weight is on your chest, can be disorienting, and in the half-dreamy moments of awakening, people sometimes imagine dark entities or demons holding them down or watching them from the corner of the room. These do seem to be hallucinations though, as the people have been able to get rid of the entities simply by calming themselves while in the experience (i.e. removing their fear).

In order to assist in achieving sleep paralysis without losing complete consciousness permanently, I used a periodic timer. The timer I selected is an iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad app simply called "Timer" by Francis Bonnin. It is very helpful in that you can set relative or absolute timing, and the timers can loop repeatedly. I set up a timer to chime every 15 minutes, looping infinitely.

I think that I was getting very close to the sleep paralysis mode, except my wife woke up and disturbed me. When I woke up, my muscles felt very relaxed and a bit resistant to being moved. I would almost call it a partial sleep paralysis. Will try again a bit later or possibly around 4:30am tomorrow morning.

#### 20:18-21:30
Tried again, this time with an empty home and no one else around. I guess I'm not doing something right, because the bell/timer woke me up, but no sleep paralysis onset. I'll keep trying.

## 2012/08/11
#### 08:13
I tried again to cause sleeping paralysis before going to bed yesterday. However, some sources say that night-time is the worst time because your body is primed to fall asleep. But I had my timer going, so I thought I would be okay.

I'm not sure when but my iPod Touch's battery died in the middle of the night. I was planning to wake at 4:30am and stay up for 45 minutes, then go back to sleep and try the timer method. The timer method is basically just waking yourself up and then sleeping again repeatedly using a timer. The key is not to move the body when waking up. This evidently wavers your body around the waking-sleeping threshold, confuse the body and induces waking sleep paralysis. Didn't work for me yet since my alarm clock (iPod Touch) died. :(

I'm try again now though.

#### 14:18
Just woke up from sleeping a second time today with my wife.
Since I missed waking at the optimal time for OBEs (4:30-5:00am) this morning, I decided to try inducing sleep paralysis again while I was at least close. The session was pretty much normal one recommended in Lucidology 101 (http://www.lucidology.com/blog/category/lucidology-101/). The only differences were that I did not do the "roll" step of the stop-drop-roll method and I didn't have a timer. The reason for no timer is I didn't want to bother my wife.

Anyway, things progressed normally, and I could feel myself relaxing quite a bit. I tried a bit of all of the [techniques for speeding up sleep paralysis](http://www.lucidology.com/blog/79/sleep-commands/) described on Lucidology 101 (you will probably have to sign up for a free membership to view the above link. Only requires an email address).

However, I wasn't conscious of ever achieving 100% sleep paralysis. At some point I guess I drifted into real sleep and dreamed of having an OBE (I know it was a dream because I woke up my wife and told her about it immediately after, but the next day, she said I never woke her up).

## 2012/08/12
#### 14:49
I slept from about 06:30 this morning until about 12:00, woke up for about 10 minutes then slept again until 14:00. When lying down the first time, my only sleep-related goal was to remember my dreams, which I was able to achieve to a lesser extent. 

The second time I slept, I put on earbud headphones and had a cyclic 15-minute timer running. My goal was to try to induce hypnotic fractionation by repeatedly sleeping and waking up. However, after about three rings of the timer, I was still awake having not slept one. I felt very uncomfortable in what I can only describe as partial sleep paralysis. My body just felt heavy, while my mind refused to sleep. I think that I am still too excited about the whole OBE idea and its potential, which could be impacting my ability relax. I started to have some significant pain in my lower back, o I gave up, removed the headphones and just slept.

On the plus side, I had a good amount of dream recall this time.

## 2012/08/13
#### 19:45
I tried again to do the timer method (repeatedly sleeping and waking up with the assistance of a cyclic timer in order to induce sleeping paralysis). I lay down on the floor on my left side in our living room with a pillow and earbud headphones one connected to my iPod that has the timer.

The first beep woke me up, actually caused me to jump a bit, then I don't think I even heard subsequent beeps. After some amount of time I'm not aware of (felt like about 30 minutes), I woke up without moving and felt my body in a very relaxed state, although it sort of hurt in some areas as if my body was begging me to move.

I decided to give up for the evening and started to move my leg, and **was unable to move my left foot**. It felt as if it were completely asleep and I just thought that circulation to that foot must have been constricted, since I was sleeping on my left side and it was under my other foot.

It gradually started to wake up and I was able to move it again. However, the entire reawakening was absent of that uncomfortable, prickly feeling that usually accompanies circulation returning to a limb that has fallen asleep. So I can only conclude that my foot did not lose circulation, but that it was actually under sleep paralysis!

This is a big milestone, since **I've now been able to induce full sleep paralysis in one of my limbs**. Now I feel I am making progress. Next milestone - full body sleep paralysis!

#### 16:21
I just tried again today to induce an OBE.
This time I played the lucidology-101-rhythm-napping-timer-ramp-2-minute-base-73-mins.mp3 timer on my laptop and lay down in my bedroom.
I left a lamp on so that the room would not be too dark and I could relax.

I did the stop-drop-roll method and ended rolled over on my right-side.
after rolling over on my right side, I stopped moving.
One thing I should note is that before doing this, I ate a plate of soba (Japanese buckwheat noodles).
After about 45 minutes, while lying on my right side my stomach started growling a whole lot which was distracting.

I really start to lose a sense of time when I do this stuff.
However, I believe I was conscious the entire time.
The beeping is startling me a bit less, but I was not ever asleep.
I think my mind may be too alert perhaps? Not sure.
When I stopped, by entire body felt like jello, but I could still move all limbs.

One additional thing worth noting is that, after waking up, my right leg is quite itchy and a bit of my left leg also.
This is the second time I've noticed this reaction after trying to induce an OBE.
My skin has some very small bumps that are itchy.
I will need to keep an eye on this.

## 2012/08/15
#### 14:52
I just woke up from an afternoon nap and I felt **very real vibrations**!
I think I was close to having an OBE.

I had been out working at a Starbucks earlier today and stopped to have Indian for lunch.
I work from home so am able to freely adjust my work hours how I like.
Anyway, I suddenly felt incredibly gassy and uncomfortable, so I decided to go home and take a nap.

I lay down on my left side and just fell asleep to take a normal nap.
At some point, I felt myself awaken.
I guess that the recent practice with the timer method has caused me to be more calm when I wake up and generally interested in experiencing those waking moments without moving.
So I did not immediately move.
Instead I was **aware of my eyes slightly twitching up and down rapidly**.
I focused my attention on trying to still them, because recently this has felt like it has helped me enter deeper sleep paralysis.

Shortly thereafter, I experienced **the black background of my eyelids gradually transition into static**, almost as if my face were a few inches from the front of an analog television tuned to a non-existent channel, but the static wasn't blurry as it would usually be so close to your face.
Instead, it was crystal clear static (if that makes sense).

In unison with the static visual stimuli, I **began to feel vibrations happening through my whole body** (and some accompanying noise, but my attention focused more on the visual stimuli).
The closest thing I can compare the vibrations to was being in a massage chair [like this one](https://github.com/rakudayo/consciousness/blob/master/logs/resources/ep30005brownrecline.jpg?raw=true) when the entire chair was vibrating, except the chair actually covered the top of my body also.

As the vibrations got stronger, I decided that this was enough for the first experience (I tend to like to experience things in baby steps), so I started to crack open my eyes.
It seemed like normal when I crack open my eyes, even my vision was a bit blurry from my eyelashes.
I started to try to move my body gently, but nothing moved.
That is when I realized I **was in some level of waking sleep paralysis**.
In retrospect, I wish that I had tried more vigorously to move my body at this time to determine if I was in full sleep paralysis, which is my next milestone.
However, I assumed I was and that it would be boring to just lay there and possibly have bad hallucinations, so I closed my eyes again and started to relax.

The visual static and vibrations came back again almost immediately.
This time I tried to "push through" the static, although I'm not sure what that meant.
I just felt a directional sense and pushed in the direction I thought would get me through.
(I've heard you shouldn't do this, as it just wastes your energy, but I had the egotistical thought that "I'm somehow special, I have lots of energy.")
I **felt the vibrations getting stronger** and felt like I was pushing slowly through at half or a third the normal movement rate through this medium, whatever it was.
It felt like I was pushing against an elastic net or cobweb, the way it would stretch, except I was actually making it through (I felt).

Anyway, from this point on I have a strong feeling I was dreaming.
I remember the static melting away into a scene that looked similar to how Neo sees the matrix at the end of the matrix (but not green, it was more graytoned).
I heard this voice that said something that I could hear at the time, but cannot remember now.
I do remember seeing a still, cartoony image of a thin, old man without any shirt on pulling some stream of red out of something else off the edge of the cartoon frame.
I felt like this should be me he is pulling out.
The old man was saying something like, "Out you go!"
Then I had a conversation with this old man.
He struck me as the kind of intelligent character who talks to himself a lot.
He said something about having to stay on our toes for the second war when it comes.
I remember asking him, "There's been a first war?"
Then he looked at me suddenly and I was back in my body waking up.

Not sure what happened there, but on the plus side, I don't feel gassy anymore.

Today has been a very busy day between work, looking for an apartment, and meeting my wife's cousin in Tokyo.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do an experimentation today.

Too busy with work to do any experimentation today.

This afternoon, around 13:00, I tried to do the Wake-Back-to-Sleep OBE induction method.
It didn't really work, as I'm still having trouble relaxing enough to actually fall asleep.
I think the fact that paying attention to my body as it relaxes is so intriguing coupled with my hunger for verifiable evidence of the OBE phenomenon are the root causes of my inability to relax.
The timer just continues to beep over and over again, which I continue to lay there still and heavy.
I feel my body becoming extremely heavy and lethargic all over, but no actual paralysis occurs.
The closest I've ever come yet to sleeping paralysis happened when I went to sleep with no expectations whatsoever.
Tomorrow I need to work so that I can go apartment hunting on Monday, so no practice possible tomorrow.

## 2012/08/24
#### 23:00
This morning, from around 08:30 to 12:00, I tried to do the Wake-Back-to-Sleep OBE induction method.
This time I was able to forget about having the earbuds in and actually fall asleep, except I slept through most of the 3 hours MP3 which had periodic beeps.
I turned down the volume of the beeps midway because they were startling me and I felt myself jump a bit.
After turning them down, they stopped startling me, but I guess the volume was too low because eventually I fell asleep and woke up 3 hours later.
No luck today, but at least I got some practice in.
I guess I need to keep the volume a bit louder and get to the point where I don't get startled by it.

## 2012/08/28
#### 14:00
This afternoon I lay down in my bed and tried to induce waking sleep paralysis using the Timer Method. I had just finished weightlifting in the gym and was able to fall asleep fairly easily. After about 1 1/2 hours, I noticed the timer did wake me up and I moved a bit, then went back to sleep.

The timer continued to wake me up and I experienced my eyes moving up and down a bit fast as I became aware. However, no strange feelings were experienced unlike [on 8/15](https://github.com/rakudayo/consciousness/blob/master/logs/diary/201208.markdown#20120815). 

Eventually, I just woke up.

## 2012/08/29
#### 12:36
This morning, around 08:30, I went back to bed since I had only slept about 4 hours last night.

I first tried about 45 minutes to use the timer method on the couch in our living room. I did fall asleep and was woken numerous times by the timer. However, no strange feelings occurred.

At about 09:15, I decided to give up for today and went to my bedroom to sleep next to my wife. I'm unsure what time this occurred, but I suddenly because aware of what I thought was the ceiling of my bedroom. However, there appeared to be a shape almost like the outline of a large shark bending its body in mid-swim. It was frozen in place but I got this feeling I was on the bottom of an ocean looking up at the surface.

Then I had two rapid thoughts. First, what am I doing at the bottom of the ocean when I was just sleeping in my bedroom? Second, this must be a dream brought on by the movie I watched on youtube last night about extreme super-Earths that are completely covered by water.

Immediately, I became awake (or extremely lucid). I opened my eyes and realized that I **could not move my body at all**. I remember thinking that the room was becoming darker, feeling a bit of fear set in. The room did seem to get darker, as if there was a dark cloud settling over me. Then I forced myself to think of a cute, fluffy kitten walking across my chest. After I started thinking of fluffy kittens, I didn't see any, but I did calm down and the fear and darkness seemed to recede.

I then focused on changing my breathing patterns, which seemed to help me un-paralyze. After regaining movement, I remember looking over next to me and seeing my sleeping wife, then closing my eyes again and repeating in my head something like, "God, show me who you are. I want to know you." I think the reason I felt I should say these words is that the previous night I had watched [this man's account of his NDE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6va_5Wf2Pc) (Near Death Experience). What struck me is the surprising simplicity of what he says God told him he should do to avoid the lonely place he called Hell: "Get to know me."

After I said this, I felt this **pleasant pulse of warm vibrational energy** (that is the best I can describe the sensation) that seemed to strengthen in the back of my head and shower or fall through my body in a wave lasting about 3-5 seconds. I have this feeling sometimes, quite often recently, when I listen to a song or watch a movie that evokes a strong emotional response in me or sometimes just by breathing deeply and contemplating the idea that I might be more than just my physical body. I should also comment that this was very different from the vibrations I experienced earlier this month on [Aug 15th](https://github.com/rakudayo/consciousness/blob/master/logs/diary/201208.markdown#20120815).

Also, at some point I noticed I heard these **rushing sounds**, like a strong wind blowing into my ears, but sort of interrupted periodically by silence. It rather sounded like the wind was blowing at me in irregular, periodic rushes. I have heard that these sounds are precursors to OBEs, but I didn't expect to hear these sounds in any way, as I didn't think I was anywhere close to an OBE.

After I felt the warm energetic wave, I continued to lay there for a bit until I guess I fell asleep (or lost lucidity).

Finally, I want to emphasize that I cannot be 100% objectively sure that this experience of sleep paralysis did not just happen in a very lucid dream instead of the actual physical (waking) world, since I went to sleep shortly after. I do think it is likely I woke up while still in sleep paralysis, but to be 100% sure, I need to shake myself out of the paralysis, then wake up immediately after and maintain continuity of consciousness. I want to be as rigorous as possible in verifying these feelings/experiences are not just figments of my own imagination.

## 2012/08/31
#### 20:15 - 22:00
I tried the timer method this evening.

I turned dimmed the lights in our living room, lay down on the couch bed and started my timer. I fell asleep and woke up repeatedly thanks to the timer, but at no time did I feel I was in sleep paralysis. I did feel my limbs were extremely sluggish, but not paralyzed.

I once felt that maybe my eyes were moving like in REM sleep, rapid up and down micro-movements, and I tried to still them. Whenever I do this, I notice at least some deepening of my relaxation.

No waking sleep paralysis today.
