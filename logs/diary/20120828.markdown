This afternoon I lay down in my bed and tried to induce waking sleep paralysis using the Timer Method. I had just finished weightlifting in the gym and was able to fall asleep fairly easily. After about 1 1/2 hours, I noticed the timer did wake me up and I moved a bit, then went back to sleep.

The timer continued to wake me up and I experienced my eyes moving up and down a bit fast as I became aware. However, no strange feelings were experienced like on 8/15. 

Eventually, I just woke up.
