#### 20:15 - 22:00
I tried the timer method this evening.

I turned dimmed the lights in our living room, lay down on the couch bed and started my timer. I fell asleep and woke up repeatedly thanks to the timer, but at no time did I feel I was in sleep paralysis. I did feel my limbs we extremely sluggish, but not paralyzed.

I once felt that maybe my eyes were moving like in REM sleep, rapidly moving up and down, and I tried to still them. Whenever I do this, I notice at least some deepening of my relaxation.

No waking sleep paralysis today.
