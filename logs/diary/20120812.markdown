#### 14:49
I slept from about 06:30 this morning until about 12:00, woke up for about 10 minutes then slept again until 14:00. When lying down the first time, my only sleep-related goal was to remember my dreams, [which I was able to achieve to a lesser extent](https://github.com/rakudayo/consciousness/blob/efbf68eb912329951cfb3a4f38173d2d071238a0/logs/dreamlog/201208.txt#L18-23). 

The second time I slept, I put on earbud headphones and had a cyclic 15-minute timer running. My goal was to try to induce hypnotic fractionation by repeatedly sleeping and waking up. However, after about three rings of the timer, I was still awake having not slept one. I felt very uncomfortable in what I can only describe as partial sleep paralysis. My body just felt heavy, while my mind refused to sleep. I think that I am still too excited about the whole OBE idea and its potentia, which could be impacting my ability relax. I started to have some significant pain in my lower back, o I gave up, removed the headphones and just slept.

On the plus side, I had a [good amount of dream recall this time](https://github.com/rakudayo/consciousness/blob/95a2d79f8a2a9bb7bde4a16452811377514f378a/logs/dreamlog/201208.md) (see 2012/08/12 12:15-14:00).
