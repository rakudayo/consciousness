I lay down in my bedroom for an afternoon nap, as I was feeling quite tired. I had the vague desire to experience an OBE, but I decided I wasn't going to do my usual thing and try hard to do it.

I lay for a time, it felt like perhaps twenty minutes, with nothing significant happening. Finally, I turned over on my side and tried to give up and go to sleep.

I'm not quite sure what the "trigger" was, but I began to "come to" again. At that point I achieved lucidity and realized I was asleep with my eyes closed. I then began to perceive the strong vibrations I've explained often before.

As soon as they became strong enough, I interpreted that as a sign I was okay to exit. I heard myself gasp, though I'm not sure if I actually did gasp or not. I do remember this gasping was because I almost felt that I was suddenly being being pulled out or like I was suddenly falling out of myself. I also had the feeling that the gasp was familiar, as if I had done it before, perhaps during a previous OBE.

I then had the feelings of trying to push my way out or through something that began vibrating more and more the harder I pushed. It was exactly the same feeling as [this experience], although this time I felt I was actually getting out of my body to some extent.

As I felt my head leaving my physical body I tried to open my eyes. It was extremely hard to open my eyelids, as if they were very heavy or I was very tired, although I was successful in opening both and I did see my room. It wasn't quite as it usually is. It was dark and I couldn't see very well at all, but it appeared there were these weird two-dimensional, almost cartoonish beings hovering around my bedside as I continued to struggle to get up against some perceived force holding me down. I felt I was out of my body down to my upper chest, but I was getting stuck from there down. (Incidentally, the experience felt similar to a recurring dream I've had in the past where I am having difficulty seeing properly and moving properly in my dreams. I wonder if this might be related somehow.)

The "things" I saw, if they were truly things at all, were not directly holding me or interacting with me exactly. They felt somehow animalistic and I seemed to hear some auditory sounds like hooting and hollering that invoked a primal, tribal feeling. I remember that I was excited, but not frightened. It might have been because the things did not seem that real to me, but more like static, 2D paper cut-outs. I remember thinking they were holding me down and I said in my head in the voice of Gandalf from the Lord of the Rings, "You have no power here!" This felt like my normal thinking processes and it was created completely within my own mind.

I tried a second time to free myself from this situation and that is when I awoke and felt myself move my physical body. I'm unsure to what extent I way moving before this point. It would be very interesting to video record myself and see.

In retrospect, I suspect that two things prevented me from smoothly transitioning to a full Out of Body Experience as has happened on another occasion. First, I was relatively low in energy and tired when I lay down. Second, and more importantly, I think that I should have relaxed when I perceived the vibrations and allowed things to settle down before trying to exit. I get the feeling that I was somehow trying to get "off the boat" before reaching my intended destination, and things were getting weird because of it.

Next time I will relax when I feel those vibrations and wait until they stop and I feel lighter. It seems like the vibrations are indicating that I'm shifting from one place to another, almost like changing a radio station produces static until you reach the next station. My next goal is to perceive my sleeping body, then leave the location of where I am sleeping and explore this other world (during the day is preferable).

I was lying down on my bed, again listening to the recording of the whispering person on loop. The second time I awoke and felt vibrations, I was finally able to separate. This time I think it was that I relaxed during the vibrations and waited until they felt more stabilized before trying to move. I got out completely by just trying to get up from the couch.

This time, though, I was completely blind. I took a few steps forward in my friend's living room. I reached up to pull my eyes open and was surprised that I felt my glasses on my face. Took them off and cast them aside. After one failed attempt, I pried open my right eye then my left. They seemed to have been stuck together, but didn't feel gunky or anything.

Now able to see, I made my way to the kitchen. I had the impression I was lumbering around. Everything was sort of a whirlwind, because I felt it was a race against time; I needed to get to the playing cards on top of the fridge and see something before I woke up.

When I got to the kitchen I realized how dark the place was. I reached over to the left and struggled to flip on the lights. Strangely, I was successful at flipping on some lights, even though I was moving my hands along the opposite wall from where the lights actually are. The lights were still much dimmer than normal, though, and it seemed like the light was focused on area of the top of the fridge (exactly where I wanted/needed it).

I dashed over to the fridge and was somehow able to get up and see down over it.

I was confused because I saw about 6 or 7 cards scattered across the top of the fridge, not just one card as I expected. The cards I made out were:

-------------------------------
2 clubs
3 (not clubs)
4

King (black face)

8 (also black?) <--- less sure
-------------------------------

After a few seconds of trying, it seemed like the scene on the top of the fridge faded away from the view. I could still kind of see the cards in my minds eye and was trying to sort them all out. Finally, I realized I was probably back in my body, as the vibrations had died down and things were more quiet.

I then opened my eyes, woke up and started writing this.

I have to wait until the morning to have my friend check the card(s). I don't have a lot of confidence I'll get them right, though, because I suspect he would only put one up there. Also, the world seems less stable than it should have been in an objective representation of reality, which would be needed for a access to objective information. The world felt perhaps malleable and a bit more like a dream world.

EDIT: I checked with my friend and he did not put multiple cards above the refrigerator. In addition, the card was a 5 of Diamonds.
