#### 23:00
This afternoon, around 13:00, I tried to do the Wake-Back-to-Sleep OBE induction method.
It didn't really work, as I'm still having trouble relaxing enough to actually fall asleep.
I think the fact that paying attention to my body as it relaxes is so intriguing coupled with my hunger for verifiable evidence of the OBE phenomenon are the root causes of my inability to relax.
The timer just continues to beep over and over again, which I continue to lay there still and heavy.
I feel my body becoming extremely heavy and lethargic all over, but no actual paralysis occurs.
The closest I've ever come yet to sleeping paralysis happened when I went to sleep with no expectations whatsoever.
Tomorrow I need to work so that I can go apartment hunting on Monday, so no practice possible tomorrow.
